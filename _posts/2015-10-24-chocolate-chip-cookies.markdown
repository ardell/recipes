Ingredients
-----------
- 2 1⁄4 cup flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 2 tsp kosher salt
- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, partially melted
- 3⁄4 cup granulated white sugar
- 1⁄2 cup tightly packed brown sugar (plus 3 additional tablespoons)
- 1 large egg and 1 egg yolk (room temperature)
- 2 tsp vanilla
- 1 1⁄2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips

Instructions
------------

Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. In a medium size bowl,
whisk melted butter, brown sugar, and white sugar together until no brown sugar
lumps remain. Whisk in the egg, then the egg yolk, and the vanilla. Pour the
wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix together. Fold in the
chocolate chips. Cover the dough and chill for 2 hours.

Preheat the oven for 325 degrees. Line 2 large baking sheets with Parchment
paper.

Roll the dough into balls. Bake the cookies for 11-12 minutes. Allow to cool on
the cookie sheet for 10 minutes before moving to wire rack to cool completely.
