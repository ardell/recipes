Ingredients
-----------
- Beef short ribs
- Montreal steak seasoning
- 1 red pepper (yes, as above) 

Instructions
------------
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Submerse each short rib in boiling water
for 10 seconds to kill surface bacteria.

Place ribs directly into ziploc bag. Add a generous amount of Montreal steak
seasoning to the bag. Double bag and seal. Cook at 144 degrees fahrenheit for
72 hours, checking every ~12 hours to make sure no leaks have formed.

Remove short ribs from bag, dry, and place on foil on a cookie sheet. Rub
lightly with olive oil. Broil on high until a brown crust forms.
