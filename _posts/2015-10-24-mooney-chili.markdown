Ingredients
-----------

- 1 1/2 to 2 lb. ground beef
- 1 onion chopped
- 1 can of chili beans
- 4 Tab. chili powder
- 4 cans of stewed tomatoes (there is a Mexican blend of these that is good to use but not necessary)
- 1 can of tomato sauce

Instructions
------------

Brown ground beef part way then add onions and finish cooking the 2 together.
Add chili powder, stir and let cook 2 more minutes. Add chili beans, stewed
tomatoes and tomato sauce. Simmer for 3 hours or more, stirring occasionally.
Lower heat after about an hour and place a lid on the pot but leave a crack.
Serve with good homemade bread - we like cornbread the best.
