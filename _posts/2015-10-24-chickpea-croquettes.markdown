Ingredients
-----------
- 1 c whole wheat flour
- 3/4 c hot water
- juice of 1/2 lemon
- 2 t ground cumin
- 1 1/2 t salt
- 15-oz can chickpeas, rinsed and drained well
- 4 scallions, chopped
- 1/2 red bell pepper, finely chopped
- 1 habanero or jalapeno, minced
- 3 garlic cloves , minced
- 2 T chopped cilantro leaves
- 3 T olive oil

Instructions
------------
In a large bowl, add flour, water, lemon juice, cumin and salt. Stir until well
combined. Add in chickpeas, scallions, pepper, habanero, garlic and cilantro.
Stir well.

In a large saucepan, heat olive oil, over medium heat. With your hands, form
the chickpea mixture into 8 patties, about 1/2" thick (the patties may be quite
wet, but will stay together when cooked). Place 4 patties in the pan, and cook
4-5 minutes, until the bottoms begin to brown. With a spatula, flip patties,
and cook 4-5 minutes on the other side, until that side begins to brown.
Transfer to a plate, or cook for an additional minute on each side, until
desired doneness. Repeat with the remaining 4 patties. Serve with sour cream,
salsa, or chopped avocado.
