Ingredients
-----------
- 1 tablespoon + 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
- 1 small/medium sweet yellow onion, diced small
- 1 clove garlic, peeled and minced finely
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 cups vegetable or chicken stock
- 2 cups heavy cream or half & half
- 2 to 3 cups broccoli florets, diced into bite-size pieces + 1 cups stems, optional
- 2 large carrots, trimmed, peeled, and shredded or sliced into very thin rounds, about 1/16th-inch
- 3/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
- 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika or regular paprika, or to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard powder, or to taste
- pinch cayenne pepper, optional and to taste
- 8 ounces grated high quality extra-sharp cheddar cheese, with a small amount reserved for garnishing bowls

Instructions
------------
1. In a small saucepan, add 1 tablespoon butter, the diced onion, and sauté
over medium heat until the onion is translucent and barely browned, about 4
minutes. Stir intermittently.

2. Add the garlic and cook about 30 seconds, stirring constantly so it doesn’t
burn. Remove from heat and set pan aside.

3. In a large heavy-bottom pot add 4 tablespoons butter, flour, and cook over
medium heat for about 3 to 5 minutes, whisking constantly, until flour is
thickened. You are making a roux and it's very important the mixture is thick
or soup will never thicken properly later.

4. Slowly add the vegetable or chicken stock, whisking constantly.

5. Slowly add the cream, whisking constantly.

6. Allow mixture to simmer over low heat for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until
it has reduced and thickened some. Whisk intermittently to re-incorporate the
‘skin’ that inevitably forms, this is normal.

7. While mixture is simmering, chop the broccoli and carrots. After simmering
15 to 20 minutes, add the broccoli, carrots, and the onion and garlic you
previously set aside.

8. Add the salt, pepper, optional paprika, optional dry mustard powder, and
optional cayenne. If you don’t have these seasonings on hand, it's okay, but
they do add subtle depth of flavor. Stir to combine.

9. Allow soup to simmer over low heat for about 20 to 25 minutes, or until it
has reduced and thickened some. Whisk intermittently to re-incorporate the
‘skin’ that inevitably forms, this is normal.

10. While soup simmers, grate the cheese. It’s important to use a high-quality
cheese (not the cheapest thing you can find) because the flavor of the soup
depends on it. Do not use pre-grated cheese in ziptop bags because that cheese
is resistant to melting and won’t incorporate well. After simmering about 20 to
25 minutes, add most of the cheese, reserving a small amount for garnishing
bowls. Stir in the cheese until melted and incorporated fully, less than 1
minute.

11. Transfer soup to bowls, garnish with reserved cheese, and serve! Soup will
keep airtight for 5 to 7 days in the fridge. Reheat gently in the microwave.
