Ingredients
-----------
- 10 ounces canned tuna in olive oil (Pestene, Oritz, Cento, Genova recommended)
- 2 teaspoons anchovy paste
- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
- 1 tablespoon grated lemon zest (from 1 Meyer lemon), chopped
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic (~1 clove)
- 3 tablespoons fresh squeezed meyer lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons high-quality olive oil plus extra for brushing the bread
- 1/3 cup Mascarpone cheese (or greek yogurt as substitute)
- 8 pitted and chopped kalamata olives
- 1 tablespoon drained capers
- Fine sea salt and fresh ground black pepper
- 30 slices of French baguette or ciabatta, cut diagonally

Instructions
------------
Drain all but a tablespoon of olive oil from the tuna canned or jars. Then
flake the tuna into the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade.
Add the anchovy paste, thyme, parsley, Meyer lemon zest, garlic and pulse a few
times.  Add the lemon juice, mascarpone cheese and 2 tablespoons of olive oil.
Process until almost smooth texture. Add the olives, capers, salt, and pepper
to season and process again to incorporate everything. Transfer the tuna
"tapenade" into a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1
hour. You can do it a day before and refrigerate overnight, great to enhance
all the flavors!

In the meantime, preheat the oven to 375 degrees fahrenheit or a gas grill.
Brush the baguette/ciabatta with some olive oil on one side. Arrange the bread
on a cookie sheet. Grill the crostinis on both sides until lightly browned,
about 5-8 minutes each side.

Spread the tuna "tapenade" on each crostini and garnish with some lemon zest or
fresh parsley.

Note: Italian tuna can be found in any Italian or luxury grocery store, or on
Amazon.com.
