Ingredients
-----------
- 4 eaches skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 2 eggs
- 1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed
- 1 cup olive oil for frying
- ½ cup prepared tomato sauce
- ¼ cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes
- ¼ cup chopped fresh basil
- ½ cup grated provolone cheese
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

Instructions
------------
1. Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).

2. Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable
   freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with
   the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch. Season chicken
   thoroughly with salt and pepper.

3. Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.

4. Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.

5. Place flour in a sifter or strainer; sprinkle over chicken breasts, evenly
   coating both sides.

6. Dip flour coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to
   breadcrumb mixture, pressing the crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each
   breast. Set aside breaded chicken breasts for about 15 minutes.

7. Heat 1 cup olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins
   to shimmer. Cook chicken until golden, about 2 minutes on each side. The
   chicken will finish cooking in the oven.

8. Place chicken in a baking dish and top each breast with about 1/3 cup of
   tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella
   cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle 1 to 2 tablespoons of
   Parmesan cheese on top and drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil.

9. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly, and chicken
   breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read
   thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74
   degrees C).
