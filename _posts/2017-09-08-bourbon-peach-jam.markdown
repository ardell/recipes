Ingredients
-----------
- 3 1/2 pounds ripe peaches
- 7 1/2 cups granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 1/2 cup bourbon
- 2 cinnamon sticks
- 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise or 3 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 tbsp unsalted butter
- One (6-ounce) package liquid pectin (two foil packets)

Instructions
------------
1. If you are going to preserve the jam, prepare the jars and lids: place six
half-pint jars on a rack in a large pot. Add enough water to cover the jars,
and bring to boil over high heat. Boil for 10 minutes, then turn off heat and
allow the jars to rest in the hot water. Meanwhile, put bands and lids in a
small saucepan and cover with water. Heat over medium heat until the water is
simmering, then remove the pan from heat and allow the bands and lids to rest
in hot water until ready to use.

2. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Fill a large bowl with ice water. Cut
a shallow X into the bottom of each peach and drop them into the boiling water.
Blanch for 20 to 30 seconds, then immediately plunge the peaches into the ice
water. Peel and chop the peaches. Transfer them to a blender and pulse just
until they are coarsely pureed. You should have about 4 cups of puree.

3. Transfer the peaches to a large, heavy-bottomed pot. Add the sugar, lemon
juice, bourbon, cinnamon stick, vanilla bean, and butter. Bring to a full
rolling boil over medium-high heat, stirring constantly. Add the pectin and
return the mixture to a full rolling boil. Boil hard for one minute. Remove to
pot from the heat and skim any foam from the surface with a metal spoon.
Discard the cinnamon stick and the vanilla bean.

4. Ladle hot jam into hot sterilized jars, leaving 1/4-inch headspace. Wipe
rims of the jars, cover with lids, and screw bands on until just barely tight.
Place jars on rack in pot and cover completely with water. Cover pot and bring
to a boil over high heat. Boil for 10 minutes. Turn off heat, uncover pot, and
allow jars to rest in water for five minutes. Remove jars from pot and allow
them to rest undisturbed on countertop for six hours or overnight. Preserved
jam will keep for up to one year in a cool, dark place. Unpreserved jam will
keep in the refrigerator for about six months.
