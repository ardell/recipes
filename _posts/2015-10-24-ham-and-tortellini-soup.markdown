Ingredients
-----------
- 2-3 quarts ham broth (below), chicken broth, or a combination
- 2-3 cups coarsely chopped ham
- 1 can chickpeas/garbanzo beans, drained
- 3 cups chopped kale
- 1 pound fresh cheese tortellini
- parmesan cheese for garnish

Instructions
------------

Combine broth, ham, and chickpeas in a large pot. Bring to a simmer. Add kale
and tortellini and simmer until kale is wilted and tortellini is just cooked,
about 6 minutes. Serve with grated parmesan cheese.

If not serving immediately, cook tortellini in a separate pot. Quickly cool
under cold water to stop cooking process. Toss with a little olive oil to
prevent sticking. When ready to serve, heat soup and add in tortellini to just
heat through.

Ham Broth
---------

- ham bone with a little meat on it
- you can also add: other ham scraps, vegetable scraps such as carrot pieces,
  onion pieces, celery pieces, peppercorns

Place ham bone (and other scraps if using) in a very large pot. Fill the pot
with enough water to more than cover.

Bring the water to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer. Let simmer for about 3
hours. Add a little water once or twice an hour to maintain level.

Remove from heat and remove bones and any vegetables. Strain to remove any
remaining pieces and discard. Taste the broth- if watery or not flavorful
enough, return to a boil and allow some of the water to evaporate until a good
flavor is achieved. If too strong, add a little water.

Cool broth to room temperature. Transfer to the refrigerator and chill for a
few hours, until fat has solidified on top. Remove solidified fat before using.
