PREP: 20 minutes, plus at least 30 minutes chilling
COOK: 15 to 20 minutes
COOL: 5 minutes

Makes about 20 biscuits

Ingredients
-----------
- 4 cups self-rising flour, plus more for the work surface
- 2 tablespoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ¾ pound (3 sticks) salted butter, cold, cut into ½-inch pieces or grated
- 2 large eggs, beaten, plus 1 large egg for brushing
- 1½ cups buttermilk, or as needed, plus 1 tablespoon for brushing
- Jam or gravy, for serving

Instructions
------------
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and baking soda.
   Add the butter and use a pastry blender to cut the butter into the flour
   until the pieces are even and about the size of peas.

2. Stir in the beaten eggs with a wooden spoon until combined. Stir in 1½ cups
   buttermilk until the dough comes together into a sticky mass. If it is too
   dry, add more buttermilk 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing after each addition,
   until it reaches the correct consistency. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for
   at least 30 minutes and up to overnight.

3. Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 400°F.
   Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

4. Scrape the dough onto a floured work surface. Use your floured hands to
   press it into a round roughly 14 inches across and about ½ inch thick.

5. Use a floured 2¾- inch round cutter to cut out about 20 biscuits. If
   necessary, collect and pat out the scraps to cut more biscuits.

6. Transfer the biscuits to the prepared baking sheet, arranging them so that
   they all are touching.

7. In a small dish, beat together the remaining egg and 1 tablespoon
   buttermilk. Brush the mixture on the top of the biscuits.

8. Bake until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool slightly in the pan on a
   rack.

9. Biscuits are best the day they are made (and ideally fresh out of the
   oven!). Serve with strawberry jam or gravy, if desired. Store leftovers in
   an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days.

NOTE: For longer storage, arrange the biscuits about ½ inch apart on two
parchment-paper-lined baking sheets and freeze until solid. Transfer them to a
zip-top plastic bag and freeze for up to 2 weeks. There is no need to thaw them
before baking.
