Ingredients
-----------
- 1 rotisserie chicken
- 12 cups chicken broth
- 1 cup uncooked orzo
- 5 medium-size lemons
  - 4 for juicing (about 2/3 cup juice)
  - 1 sliced thin for garnishing
- 4 large eggs at room temperature
- Coarsely cracked black peppercorns
- 4 bay leaves
- 1 onion, diced
- 2 leeks, sliced
- 2 carrots, shredded

Instructions
------------

Remove meat from rotisserie chicken, cut to bit-sized pieces and refrigerate.

Place the chicken broth in a stockpot and add the chicken carcass and bay
leaves. Bring it to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for about 1 hour.

Strain the broth and set aside.

Heat a small amount of olive oil in the pot and add the onion. Sautee for 4
minutes. Add leeks and sautee an additional 2 minutes. Add carrots and sautee
for 1 minute.

Add 4 cups of broth to the vegetable mixture and immersion-blend vegetables to
a puree.

Add the rest of the broth and the orzo and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat,
cover and boil for 15 minutes or until the orzo is soft. Add the chicken. Leave
the soup on the burner with the lid on but turn the burner off.

Whisk the lemon juice and eggs together in a small bowl. Add one ladle of warm
soup broth to the lemon-egg mixture, whisking continually until incorporated.
Add another ladle of broth, whisking.

Pour the lemon-egg mixture into the pot of soup and stir until combined and
smooth. (The temperature of the soup will cook the egg.)

Serve immediately, garnished with slices of lemon and coarsely ground black
peppercorns.

Optional Orzo-free Version
--------------------------

Used minced carrots (about the size of orzo) instead of orzo for texture.

Cook onion and leeks first. Blend and set aside. Sautee carrots. Then add
blended vegetables back in and continue as normal.
