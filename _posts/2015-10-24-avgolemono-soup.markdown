Ingredients
-----------
- 1/2 rotisserie chicken or 1 large cooked chicken breast, shredded into bite-sized pieces  
- 6 cups chicken broth  
- 1/2 cup orzo  
- Juice of 2 medium-size lemons (about 1/3 cup)  
- 2 large eggs at room temperature  
- Coarsely cracked black peppercorns  
- Lemon slices  

Instructions
------------

Place the chicken broth in a medium-sized stockpot and add the orzo. Bring it
to a boil, reduce the heat, cover and boil for 15 minutes or until the orzo is
soft. Add the chicken. Leave the soup on the burner with the lid on but turn
the burner off.

Whisk the lemon juice and eggs together in a small bowl. Add one ladle of warm
soup broth to the lemon-egg mixture, whisking continually until incorporated.
Add another ladle of broth, whisking.

Pour the lemon-egg mixture into the pot of soup and stir until combined and
smooth. (The temperature of the soup will cook the egg.)

Serve immediately, garnished with slices of lemon and coarsely ground black
peppercorns.
