Ingredients
-----------

**Note**
Try out different combinations of ingredients. We have used different types of
meat (other sausage varieties, bacon, ham) and different vegetables (such as
spinach) or cheese.

- sausage (country breakfast sausage or similar)
- brussel sprouts (cut in half)
- mushrooms (chopped)
- onions (chopped)
- acorn squash (about 1 per 2 people)
- sliced provolone cheese

Instructions
------------

Heat the oven to 400Â°F and arrange a rack in the middle. Cut the squash in half
lengthwise and scrape out the seeds. Cut a small slice off the rounded side of
each half to stabilize the halves so they sit upright. 

Place the halves cut-side up on a baking sheet. Coat the acorn squash with
olive oil. Sprinkle squash with salt and pepper and roast until fork-tender, 45
minutes to 1 hour. 

In a large skillet over medium heat, begin cooking the sausage.  Add the onions
and mushrooms when the sausage is about half browned. Once the onions begin to
be translucent, add the brussel sprouts. Saute until brussel sprouts are
slightly browned.

Spoon hash into squash halves and cover with a slice of provolone cheese. Place back into
oven just long enough for cheese to melt. Serve.

**Leftover hash with eggs:**
Melt 1 tbspn butter in a small skillet. Cook 2 eggs over medium and transfer to
a plate.  Heat leftover hash in skillet with leftover butter. Serve with eggs
and toast or english muffin.
