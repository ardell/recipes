Ingredients
-----------
- 12 oz parsnips (cut on the bias into 1 inch pieces)
- 4 carrots (cut into 2 1/2 inch lengths, cutting thicker end in half)
- 1 celery root (14 oz, cut off ends, peel, cut into 3/4 inch thick, 2 1/2 inches long)
- 12 oz turnips (cut off both ends, peel, cut into 8 pieces)
- 5 oz small shallots, peels removed
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon salt
- pepper
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley

Note: Use turnips that are roughly 2 to 3 inches in diameter.

Instructions
------------

Adjust oven rack to middle position, place rimmed baking sheet on rack, and heat oven to 425 degrees. 

Place parsnips, carrots, celery root, shallots. Toss with salt and pepper.
Cover and microwave for 8-10 minutes, stirring halfway through, looking for carrots to be soft (able to
bend slightly).

Drain any liquid that has accumulated.

Add turnips, oil and pepper. Stir to coat. Pour out vegetables onto pre-heated
baking sheet.  Spread out into an even layer. Roast for about 25 minutes. Turn
vegetables over and rotate the tray.  Continue to roast for another 15-25
minutes, until celery root is tender and all vegetables are golden brown.

Toss with parsley and serve.
