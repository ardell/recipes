Ingredients
-----------
- 1 cup whole raw almonds
- 2 1/4 cups bread flour
- 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup light brown sugar (packed)
- 3 large eggs (at room temperature)
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil
- 1 tbsp almond extract
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 tsp lemon zest

Instructions
------------
Preheat oven to 325Â° F. Position rack in the center.

Spread almonds on a baking sheet and toast in oven for about 12-15 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients (flour, baking
powder, salt and sugars).

In a large bowl, whisk eggs. Add olive oil, extracts, and zest. Whisk lightly
together.

When almonds are toasted, remove from oven and coarsely chop.

Line baking sheet with parchment paper.

Add flour mixture to egg mixture; stir with wooden spoon until just
incorporated.

Fold in chopped almonds (make sure they have cooled off before incorporating in
the batter).

Divide dough into half. Place each half on a large cookie sheet. With damp
fingers,  shape into a log shape.

Bake for approximately 30 minutes or until golden brown in colour and firm. Let
cool slightly.

Remove from baking sheet and transfer to cutting board.

Using a serrated knife, slice cookies approximately 1/2 - 3/4 inch thick.

Place slices (standing up) back on the baking sheets, and return them to the
oven for about another 15 - 20 minutes (the longer they stay in the oven, the
crispier they get). 

Place on a wire rack to cool.

Store in an airtight container at room temperature for 3 days or freeze for up
to 3 months.
