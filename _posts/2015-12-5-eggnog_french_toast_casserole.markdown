Ingredients
-----------
- 1 loaf French bread or challah bread, sliced 1/2 to 1 inch thick
- 8 large eggs
- 2 cups whole milk
- 2 cups eggnog
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1⁄2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1⁄2 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
- a pinch of salt

**TOPPING**

- 12 tablespoons salted butter (1 1/2 sticks)
- 2 cups vanilla wafers, crushed

Instructions
------------

Heat oven to 325°F.

Arrange sliced bread in a single layer on two baking sheets. Bake bread until
dry and lightly browned; about 25 minutes.

Remove from oven and allow bread to cool. Then cut slices into cubes.

Butter or spray the bottom and side of 9 by 13 pan with non-stick cooking
spray. Add bread cubes to the prepared pan, spreading evenly.

Whisk together the eggs, milk, eggnog, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, cloves and
nutmeg.  Pour evenly over bread.  Press lightly on the bread to submerge.

Cover with plastic and refrigerate for 8 to 24 hours.

**Before Baking:**

Preheat oven to 350°F.

Melt the butter and mix with the crushed vanilla wafers.  Spoon the topping
over the casserole and spread evenly.

Place the dish on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until puffed and golden, about
60 minutes.  Cool for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.

Notes
------

My mother always made eggnog challah bread french toast on Christmas morning. It
is a holiday tradition I will continue. When I needed to make a dish for a Christmas
brunch potluck, I knew I needed a casserole version. I adapted a french toast casserole
recipe from America's Test Kitchen. I also chose not to use nuts due to known
allergies, and vanilla wafers just came to mind.
