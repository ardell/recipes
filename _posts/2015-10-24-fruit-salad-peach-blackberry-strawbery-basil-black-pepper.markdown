Ingredients
-----------
- 4 teaspoons sugar
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh basil
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 (6-oz) peaches, pitted and cut into 1/2-inch pieces (about 3 cups)
- 2 cups fresh blackberries
- 1 pint strawberries, washed, hulled, and quartered lengthwise (about 2 cups)
- 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice (see note)

Instructions
------------

Combine sugar, basil and pepper in large bowl.  Using rubber spatula, press
mixture into side of bowl until sugar becomes damp, about 30 seconds.  Gently
toss fruit with sugar mixture until combined. Let stand at room temperature,
stirring occasionally, until fruit releases its juices, 15 to 30 minutes.  Stir
in lime juice to taste and serve.

Notes
-----

Because riper fruits require more acid to balance their sweetness, the lime
juice should be added to taste. Start with 1 tablesppon, then add 1 teaspoon at
a time as necessary.
