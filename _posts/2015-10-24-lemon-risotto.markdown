Ingredients
-----------
- 3 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth
- 2 cups water
- 1 shallot, finely chopped
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
- 1 1/4 cups Arborio rice
- 1/4 cup dry white wine
- 1 tablespoon grated lemon zest
- 1/4 cup grated parmesan
- 2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley

Instructions
------------
Cook shallot in 2 tablespoons butter with 1/4 teaspoon salt in a 4-quart heavy
saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5
minutes.

Add rice and cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute. Add wine and simmer, stirring
constantly, until absorbed.

Stir in 1/2 cup broth mixture and briskly simmer, stirring frequently, until
absorbed. Continue adding broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring frequently and
letting each addition be absorbed before adding the next, until rice is creamy
and tender but still al dente (it should be the consistency of a thick soup),
about 18 minutes. (There will be leftover broth mixture.)

Stir in zest, remaining 2 tablespoons butter, parmesan, parsley, and
pepper to taste. (Thin risotto with some of remaining broth if necessary.)
