YIELDS: 12 doughnuts or muffins
TIME: About 35 minutes


Ingredients
-----------
- Nonstick cooking spray
- 1 ¾ cup/225 grams all-purpose flour
- 1 ¼ teaspoon baking powder
- ¾ teaspoon fine sea salt
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
- 1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), at room temperature
- ¾ cup/165 grams light brown sugar
- ¾ cup/150 grams granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs, at room temperature
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ cup/120 milliliters apple cider

Optional High Altitude Adjustments:

- Adjust flour to 2 cups
- Reduce sugar by 2 T. total IN the RECIPE MIXTURE (I used 3/4 C brown sugar + 2 T granulated)
- Reduce butter by 2 T. IN the RECIPE MIXTURE (I used 8 T butter, or 1 stick, instead of 10 T.)
- Increase apple cider by about 3 T (I used 2/3 C.  cider, or 10-2/3 T., instead of 1/2 C, or 8 T.)

Instructions
------------
1. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease 2 6-cavity doughnut pans (or a
   12-cup muffin tin) with nonstick spray. In a medium bowl, add the flour,
   baking powder, salt, 1 teaspoon cinnamon and nutmeg and whisk to combine.
   Set aside.

2. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream 10
   tablespoons/140 grams butter, brown sugar and 1/4 cup/50 grams granulated
   sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the eggs
   one at a time and mix until well incorporated after each addition, scraping
   the bowl as necessary. Beat in the vanilla extract.

3. Add the flour mixture and mix on low speed until incorporated. With the
   mixer running, add the apple cider in a slow, steady stream and mix to
   combine. Scrape the bowl well to make sure the batter is homogeneous.

4. Spoon the batter into prepared doughnut pans, filling them about 2/3 of the
   way full (you can also do this using a disposable piping bag or a resealable
   plastic bag with a 1/2-inch opening cut from one corner). Bake until evenly
   golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the thickest
   portion comes out clean, 12 to 15 minutes. Rotate the pans halfway through
   baking. (If you are making muffins, divide batter evenly between the
   prepared cups and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, rotating halfway through.)

5. While the doughnuts bake, whisk the remaining 1/2 cup/100 grams granulated
   sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon together in a small bowl to combine. In a
   separate small bowl, melt the remaining 6 tablespoons of butter in the
   microwave. Let the doughnuts cool for 5 minutes after baking, then unmold
   them from the pans, brush with the melted butter and dredge them in the
   cinnamon sugar while they are still warm. Serve immediately, or let cool to
   room temperature.
