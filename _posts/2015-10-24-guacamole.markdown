Ingredients
-----------

- 6 Hass Avocados
- 3 Jalapeno peppers, seeded, and minced
- 1 red onion, finely chopped
- 1 bunch cilantro, finely chopped
- 2-3 limes, juiced
- salt

Instructions
------------

Cut avocados in half, scrape out insides into a bowl. Mash until mostly smooth.
Add about 1/3 of each: red onion, cilantro, halapenos, lime juice, 1/4 tsp salt
Add more of each ingredient to taste.

**Chipotle's Batch Recipe:**

Remove stems and stickers from 48 avocados, wash for two minutes. Cut avocados
in half, remove pit, scrape out the good stuff.

Mash avocados in large mixing bowl. You don't have to get it to the final
consistency yet, but it's easier if they're at least partially mashed at this
point.

Now for the other ingredients. Add 2-1/2 cups cilantro, 2-1/2 cups chopped red
onions, 1/2 cup chopped jalapeno, 1/2 cup lemon-lime juice, and 3 tablespoons
of salt. Continue mashing until smooth.

When you go to store the guac, put a layer of plastic wrap directly on the guac
and squeeze the air out, then put another layer of plastic over whatever
container you're using. This keeps the guac from oxidizing and turning all
brown. Depending on how long you keep it in the fridge, the top might turn
brown anyway, so just skim off the top layer before serving.
