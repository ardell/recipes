- 2 cups diced carrots
- 1 can great northern beans, rinsed
- 1 can stewed tomatoes (no special seasoning)
- 1 small lime
- about 1 lb pepper jack cheese, shredded
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 cup flour
- 1.5 qt low sodium chicken stock
- 1 tbspn ground cumin
- 8 cloves minced garlic

- olive oil

Additionally for garnish:
------------
- cilantro
- lime wedges
- sour cream
- avocado
- tortilla strips

Instructions
------------
Dice peppers, onion and carrots (to bite-size or as desired, depending on how chunky you like your soup)

Heat some olive oil in a stock pot or dutch oven over medium heat. Add the diced vegetables and 2-3 pinches of salt and sautee until carrots are tender.

Add the cumin, garlic and coriander. Stir until combined and sautee another 30-60 seconds.

Add the jar of green chile and combine. Add about 1 qt of chicken stock and stewed tomatoes. Place the chicken breasts in the pot and add more chicken stock as necessary until chicken is fully submerged. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken breasts register at 150 degrees F on an instant read thermometer (about 15-20 minutes).

Transfer chicken breasts to a bowl and let rest. Cut up stewed tomatoes into smaller, bite-size chunks using kitchen shears or similar. Continue simmering broth about 1 hr total. Turn off heat.

Make a roux in a small bowl with about 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup flour. Temper the mixture by adding small amounts of hot broth from the pot to the mixing bowl, stirring until combined before adding more. Continue until bowl is warm to the touch. Add back into the pot and stir.

Add the beans.

Add half the shredded cheese a handful at a time and stir until melted and combined.

Shred the chicken and add back to the pot. Squeeze in juice from 1/2 of a lime. Season to taste with salt. Bring back up to temperature and serve.

Don't forget to garnish as you like.
