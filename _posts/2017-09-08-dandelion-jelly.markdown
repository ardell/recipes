Ingredients
-----------
- 3 Cups dandelion tea
- 4 1/2 Cups sugar
- 2 Tbsp. lemon juice
- 1 box powdered pectin

Instructions
------------
Sterilize jars and lids and set aside.

Snip off base of each flower until you have just yellow parts (pistil, stamen
and petals). The green parts of the dandelion are bitter and are definitely not
what you want. Don't be TOO meticulous... it is ok for there to be a little bit of green.

You will need about 4 cups of petals for the recipe. 

Pour boiling water over the petals until just covered. Cover the container and
let sit until it reaches room temperature or overnight if possible. When this
has brewed you will have a darkish yellow dandelion tea.

Strain the dandelion tea through a coffee filter or or jelly bag to remove all
petals. Add additional water if needed to measure the correct amount of liquid.

Add dandelion tea, lemon juice, and 1 box of pectin into a large saucepan.
Bring to a boil. Add sugar and bring back to a boil.  Continue boiling 1-2
minutes. Remove from heat and fill jars.

Pour hot jelly into hot canning or jelly jars, leaving 1/4 inch head space. Use pints or 1/2 pints.

Process for:
- 10 minutes if you are below 6000 ft elevation.
- 15 minutes if you are above 6000 ft elevation.
