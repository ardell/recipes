Ingredients
-----------
- 4 bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts
- Olive oil, 2 tablespoons for the chicken, 2 tablespoons for the potatoes, 1/4 cup for the broth
- Salt and pepper
- Dry oregano, 1 teaspoon for the chicken, 1 teaspoon for the broth
- 4 lemons (1 quartered to go in with the chicken, 1 to be zested then juiced for the broth, 1 more to be juiced for the broth, and 1 to be sliced into thin rounds for garnish)
- 2 baking potatoes, rinsed and dried, sliced into 8 long wedges each
- 1 cup chicken stock (I really like the Better than Bouillon brand concentrate)
- 2 tablespoons grated Romano (or Parmesan) cheese
- 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon chopped parsley, for garnish

Instructions
------------
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Rub the chicken with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, then sprinkle both sides
generously with salt and pepper and 1 teaspoon oregano. Arrange chicken skin
side up in a baking pan to cook. Throw in the quartered lemon. In a separate
baking pan, toss the potato wedges with 2 tablespoons olive oil and a generous
sprinkling of salt and pepper. (The chicken and potatoes can both be rubbed
several hours in advance and refrigerated.)

Cook the chicken and potatoes until the chicken hits 165 degrees, roughly 50
minutes.

While the chicken and potatoes are cooking, whisk together the broth â€” zest of
1 lemon, juice of 2 lemons, 1/4 cup olive oil, chicken stock, grated cheese,
chopped garlic, and 1 teaspoon oregano.

If you have a meat thermometer, check the chicken at 45 minutes to see if it
has hit 165 degrees and has a light golden color to the skin. If not, give it a
few more minutes then check again.

Once the chicken is ready, pull it out and switch the oven to broil. Leave the
potatoes in for a few minutes as the broiler heats up to give them an extra
crisp. Give the broth another quick whisk and pour over the chicken into the
baking pan. Take the potatoes out of the oven, then broil the chicken for about
3 minutes, until the skin is well browned and the broth is bubbling a bit.

For each person, place 4 wedges of potato and a chicken breast into a bowl,
then spoon or pour in the sauce from the chicken pan. Garnish with chopped
parsley and thin slices of lemon.
