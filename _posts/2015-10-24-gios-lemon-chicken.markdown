Whisk together the broth â€” zest of 1 lemon, juice of 2 lemons, 1/4 cup olive

broth and quartered lemon in sous-vide circulator at 142 degrees fahrenheit for
2 hours.

Cut potatoes in half. Place face-down in a single layer in a large skillet. Add
2 cups of water, 3 sprigs thyme, 2 whole cloves garlic, 3 tablespoons unsalted
butter. Heat over medium high until it simmers, then reduce to medium and cover
for 15 minutes. Remove garlic and thyme. Turn heat up to medium high 15-20
minutes until butter begins to sizzle. Allow to cook for an additional 4-6
minutes. Mince garlic, add 1 tsp lemon juice and 1/4 tsp black pepper. Turn
heat off potatoes. Add garlic mixture to potatoes.

Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium-high in a stainless steel skillet
until it just begins to smoke. Place chicken skin side down and sear until
nicely browned.

For each person, place 4 potato halves and a chicken breast into a bowl, then
spoon or pour in the sauce from the chicken pan.

Garnish with chopped parsley and thin slices of lemon.
