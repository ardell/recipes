Ingredients
-----------
- 2 Tbsp unsalted butter
- 1 cup of finely chopped onion
- 1 celery rib, finely chopped
- 1 carrot, finely chopped
- 1/2 cup of finely chopped green onion, including the green onion greens
- 3 cloves garlic, minced (about 1 Tbsp)
- 2 teaspoon salt (use 1 1/2 teaspoons if using Italian sausage)
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
- 2/3 cup ketchup, divided 1/3 and 1/3
- 1 1/2 pounds of ground beef (chuck)
- 3/4 pound of spicy ground pork sausage or Italian sausage (a mix of sweet and hot if you are using links)
- 1 cup fresh bread crumbs (take a couple slices of fresh bread and pulse in a blender until you have crumbs)
- 2 large eggs, beaten slightly
- 1/3 cup minced fresh parsley leaves

Instructions
------------
Preheat oven to 350° F, with a rack in the middle of the oven.

Sauté onions, celery, carrot, green onions, garlic, then add salt, pepper,
Worcestershire sauce, ketchup: Melt the butter in a large, thick-bottomed
skillet, on medium heat. When the butter starts to foam, add the finely chopped
onions, celery, carrot, green onions and garlic to the pan and cook for  5
minutes.  Cover the pan and cook for another 5 minutes, until the carrots are
tender, stirring every so often.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add the
Worcestershire sauce and one-third cup of the ketchup. Cook for another minute
and remove from heat to cool.

Mix vegetables with ground beef, sausage, eggs, breadcrumbs, parsley: Once the
vegetables have cooled to the touch, place them in a large bowl with the ground
beef, Italian sausage, eggs, breadcrumbs and parsley. Use your (very clean)
hands to mix them together until everything is evenly distributed.

Place in loaf pan, cover with ketchup: Place the meatloaf mixture into a loaf
pan (either 4x8 or 5x9) and press to make compact in the pan. Or you can form a
free-standing loaf onto a rimmed baking pan. Cover the meatloaf mixture with
the rest of the ketchup.

Bake for 1 hour at 350°F, or until a meat thermometer inserted into the center
of the meatloaf reads 155°F. Remove from oven and let sit for 10 minutes. Then
use a metal spatula to gently lift the meatloaf out of the loaf pan to a
serving plate.

Make thick slices to serve.

Makes 4-6 servings.
