Ingredients
-----------
- 1 pound baby spinach
- 1 or 2 small hot green chiles (such as serranos), minced
- 3 tablespoons organic canola or high-oleic safflower oil
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 1/2 teaspoon black mustard seeds
- 3 green cardamom seeds
- 1 pinch asafoetida powder
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1-inch piece ginger, minced or grated
- 1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped
- 1 1/2 cups canned crushed tomatoes, or 3 ripe tomatoes, roughly pureed
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- 4 teaspoons ground coriander
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin powder
- 1 teaspoon turmeric
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 15 ounce cans chickpeas, rinsed
- 2 teaspoons garam masala

Instructions
------------

Bring a pot of water to boil. Add the baby spinach and cook until tender, about
1 to 2 minutes. Drain well and squeeze out excess liquid. Place in a food
processor along with the green chile, and process until smooth, adding a bit of
water only as necessary to create a puree.

Heat the oil over medium-high heat in a large deep skillet or dutch oven. Add
the cumin seeds, mustard seeds, cardamom and asafoetida and cook for 2 minutes.
Add the onions, ginger and garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until onions
start to brown around the edges, about 4-5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, lemon
juice, coriander, cumin powder, turmeric and cayenne. Reduce the heat and
simmer for 6-7 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the spinach puree, salt and
chickpeas. Partially cover and simmer for 8-10 minutes, adding a bit of water
if mixture seems too thick. Add garam masala and additional salt if needed, and
serve.
