Ingredients
-----------
- 10 medium cloves garlic, peeled
- 4 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, scrubbed clean and cut into 2-inch pieces
- 1/4 cup butter, cut into large cubes + more for serving if desired
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary + more for garnish
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/2 to 3/4 cup half-and-half
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- Additional salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Instructions
------------
Place the garlic in the bottom of a 3 1/2-quart or larger slow cooker. Top with
the potatoes. Dot with butter and sprinkle with the rosemary and salt. Pour the
water over the top.

Cook on high for 3-4 hours or low 6-8 hours, or until the potatoes and garlic
are very tender.

Using a potato masher or sturdy fork, mash the potatoes. You may need to remove
the lid and let them cool a bit before mashing. Add 1/2 cup half-and-half and
1/2 cup sour cream; continue mashing and mixing until the potatoes reach your
desired consistency. If they're too stiff, add a little more half-and-half, a
tablespoon or two at a time. Taste and, if you like, add additional salt along
with some freshly ground black pepper to taste.

Spoon into a bowl and top with a big pat of butter, if desired. Sprinkle with a
few pinches of fresh rosemary.
