Note: This is 'accidentally awesome' because we first attempted to make the
recipe in Germany where we could not get the specific meats called for. We
therefore ended up using what amounts to 50% ground beef and 50% ground pork in
place of the ground chuck, and Italian sausage in place of the original sausage
called for. It was surprisingly good!

Ingredients
-----------
- 1 cup finely chopped onion
- 1 celery rib, finely chopped
- 1 T minced garlic
- 1 carrot, finely chopped
- 1/2 cup finely chopped scallion
- 1 1/2 lbs ground chuck, or half ground beef and half ground pork
- 3/4 lb Italian sausage
- 1 cup fresh bread crumbs
- 2 large eggs, beaten slightly
- 1/3 cup minced parsely leaves
- 2 T unsalted butter
- 2 tsp salt
- 1 1/2 tsp freshly ground pepper
- 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 2/3 cup ketchup

Instructions
------------
1. Preheat oven to 350° F, with a rack in the middle of the oven.

2. In a large skillet, melt the butter. When it starts to foam, add the onions,
celery, carrot, green onions, garlic and sauté for 5 minutes.

3. Cover and cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until carrots are tender.

4. Stir in salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce and 1/3 cup ketchup. Cook for 1 more minute.
Remove from heat.

5. In a large bowl, combine meats, eggs, bread crumbs, vegetables and parsley.
Form into a loaf and place in rectangular baking pan with 2 inch high sides.
Cover loaf with remaining ketchup.

6. Bake in oven for 1 hour, or until a meat thermometer inserted into the center
of the meatloaf reads 155°F. Remove from oven and let sit for 10 minutes. Then
use a metal spatula to gently lift the meatloaf out of the loaf pan to a
serving plate.

Makes 4-6 servings.
