Ingredients
-----------
- 14-oz cubed, block firm tofu, pressed (optional replace with cubed chicken)
- 1 1/2 cup(s) orange juice
- 1 tbsp honey
- 4 clove(s) garlic, minced
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 cup(s) Chinese black rice
- 2 cup(s) water
- 4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 20 stems asparagus, tough stems removed and cut into 1 inch pieces
- 1 small bunch fresh chives, finely chopped
- 1 cup(s) basil, cut into thin strips
- 1/4 cup(s) pine nuts, toasted
- 1 tbsp red wine vinegar fresh ground pepper, to taste

Instructions
------------
Combine pressed tofu (or chicken), orange juice, honey, garlic and salt in a large bowl.
Gently toss to coat. Let sit at least 15 minutes. 

In a medium sauce pan, combine black rice and water over high heat. Bring to
boil and then reduce heat to simmer, 30 minutes. Set aside.

In a large saut√© pan, heat 2 T olive oil, over high heat. Add marinated tofu
cubes and cook 8-10 minutes, until golden brown, shaking pan often to avoid
sticking. It was taking a bit for the tofu to start browning so I spooned out
some of the marinade and allowed the tofu to brown up a bit then added it back
in. Add asparagus, and cook 5 minutes, until tender (again shaking pan often).

In a large serving bowl, gently combine tofu and asparagus with rice. Add
chives, basil and pine nuts. Drizzle with 2 T olive oil and vinegar. Gently
toss and season to taste with salt, pepper and more olive oil, vinegar, citrus
or honey, if desired.
