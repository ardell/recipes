Ingredients
-----------
For the Crisp Topping:

- 100g all-purpose flour (3 3/4 ounces; about 3/4 cup)
- 165g raw sugar, such as turbinado (5 3/4 ounces; about 3/4 cup)
- 1 tablespoon freshly grated zest from 1 lemon
- 1 1/2 teaspoons freshly grated nutmeg (see note)
- 1 teaspoon (4g) kosher salt
- 100g toasted pecans (3 3/4 ounces; about 1 cup)
- 145g unsalted butter (5 ounces; 10 tablespoons), cut into small cubes and chilled

For the Apple Base:

- 4 apples (preferably a mix of firm, tart Fuji and Jonagold as well as softer Golden Delicious), skin on, cored and diced
- 3 tablespoons sugar
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1/2 teaspoon (2g) kosher salt
- 2 tablespoons (30ml) bourbon, rye, or Scotch

Instructions
------------
Note: Topping can be made in advance of assembly and baking.

1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F.

2. In a food processor, pulse flour, raw sugar, lemon zest, nutmeg, and salt until well combined.

3. Add pecans and pulse just until pecans start to break apart, 2 to 3 pulses.
   Some whole pecans should still be visible.

4. Add butter and pulse until mixture resembles a coarse meal, with pea-sized
   chunks. Transfer to a bowl and chill in refrigerator or freezer until ready
   to bake.

5. Toss apples, sugar, cornstarch, salt, and whiskey in a
   large mixing bowl until evenly combined. Transfer to a 2-quart baking dish
   and cover with crisp topping, spreading it into an even layer across the
   dish. Do not pack topping down with your hands.

6. Bake until topping is darker in color, sandy, dry, and firm to the touch,
   about 45 minutes. Let crisp cool for at least 15 minutes before serving.
