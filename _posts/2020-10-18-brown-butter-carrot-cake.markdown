- 8 ounces light brown sugar (1 cup, gently packed; 225g)
- 4 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 4 teaspoons ground ginger

Instructions
------------
1. *Getting Ready:* To better synchronize the downtime in both recipes, prepare
   the Cream Cheese Buttercream before the cake.

2. Adjust oven rack to the middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C).

3. Toast the pecans on a baking sheet until golden brown, about 10 minutes, and
   cool completely.

4. Meanwhile, peel, trim, and shred the carrots, then measure out 24 ounces (6
   cups, firmly packed). This can be refrigerated up to 1 week in a zip-top bag.

5. In a 2-quart stainless steel saucier, completely melt the butter over
   medium-low heat. Increase to medium and simmer, stirring with a
   heat-resistant spatula while the butter hisses and pops. Continue cooking
   and stirring, scraping up any brown bits that form along the pan, until the
   butter is golden-yellow and perfectly silent. Pour into a heat-safe
   measuring cup, along with all the toasty brown bits, and proceed as
   directed, or cover and refrigerate up to 1 week; melt before using.

6. *For the Cake*: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to
   350°F (180°C). Lightly grease three 8-inch anodized aluminum cake pans and
   line with parchment (explanation and tutorial here). If you don’t have three
   pans, it’s okay to bake the cakes in stages; the batter will keep at room
   temperature until needed.

7. Combine white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, baking powder, salt,
   baking soda, nutmeg, cloves, vanilla, and eggs in the bowl of a stand mixer
   fitted with the whisk attachment. Mix on low to moisten, then increase to
   medium and whip until thick and fluffy, about 8 minutes.

8. Meanwhile, whisk together all-purpose and whole wheat flours. Drizzle in the
   brown butter in a steady stream, then reduce speed to low and add the
   flours.

9. Once smooth, fold in shredded carrots and pecans with a flexible spatula.

10. Divide batter between the prepared cake pans, about 33 ounces each. If you
   don't have three pans, the remaining batter can be held at room temperature
   up to 3 hours. Bake until cakes are golden, about 45 minutes. A toothpick
   inserted into the center will have a few crumbs still attached, and your
   fingertip will leave a slight indentation in the puffy crust.

11. Cool cakes directly in their pans for 1 hour, then run a butter knife around
   the edges to loosen. Invert onto a wire rack, peel off the parchment, and
   return cakes right side up (covered in plastic, the cakes can be left at
   room temperature for a few hours). Prepare the buttercream.

12. *For the Crumb Coat*: Level cakes with a serrated knife (full directions
   here) and set the scraps aside for snacking. Place one layer on a heavy cast
   iron turntable. If you like, a waxed cardboard cake round can first be
   placed underneath, secured to the turntable with a scrap of damp paper
   towel. Top with exactly 1 cup buttercream, using an offset spatula to spread
   it evenly from edge to edge. Repeat with the second and third layers, then
   cover the sides of the cake with another cup of buttercream, spreading it as
   smoothly as you can (tutorial here). Refrigerate cake until the buttercream
   hardens, about 30 minutes.

8. Re-whip remaining buttercream to restore its creamy consistency, then use to
   decorate the chilled cake as desired; finish with Twisted Carrot Roses or
   other decorations (optional). Let the cake return to cool room temperature
   before serving.  Under a cake dome or an inverted pot, the frosted cake and
   carrot roses will keep 24 hours at cool room temperature. After cutting,
   wrap leftover slices individually and store at cool room temperature up to 2
   days more.
