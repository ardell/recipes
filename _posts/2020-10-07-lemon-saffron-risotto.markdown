YIELDS: 4 servings
TIME: About 45 minutes (15 min prep, 30 min active cooking time)


Ingredients
-----------
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 medium onion, finely diced
- Salt and pepper
- 1 cup short-grain Italian rice, such as arborio, carnaroli, or vialone nano
- Small pinch of saffron, crumbled
- 1/4 cup white wine
- 4 cups chicken broth, heated
- Grated zest and juice of 1/2 lemon
- 2 tablespoons butter
- About 1/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese


Instructions
------------
1. In a heavy saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the
   onion, season, and cook gently until softened, about 5 minutes.

2. Add the rice and saffron, stir well to coat the rice, and let sizzle a bit.
   Allow the onion to color slightly, add the wine and a good pinch of salt,
   and cook for 1 minute.

3. Add 1 cup of the hot broth, stir, and adjust the heat to maintain a brisk
   simmer. Stir frequently as the rice absorbs the liquid. When you see little
   sinkholes on the surface of the rice, it is time to add more broth. Do this
   every 5 minutes, stirring in 1/2 cup chicken broth each time. The total
   cooking time should be 20 minutes or so, and the rice grains should still be
   a bit al dente.

4. Add the lemon zest and juice and the butter. Taste a spoonful to check the
   seasoning and adjust if necessary. Add a splash more broth if the risotto
   seems too stiff.

5. Stir in the grated Parmesan and serve in shallow soup bowls.
