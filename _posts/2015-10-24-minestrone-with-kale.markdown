Ingredients
-----------
- 2 tsp olive oil
- 2 medium uncooked zucchini, quartered lengthwise and sliced 1/4-inch thick
- 10 medium uncooked baby carrots, halved widthwise if large
- 1 medium uncooked onion(s), chopped
- 2 cup(s) uncooked kale, coarsely chopped
- 28 oz canned diced tomatoes, with basil, garlic and oregano, undrained
- 4 cup(s) vegetable broth

- 1 cup(s) cooked orzo
- 1/4 tsp table salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 3/4 cup(s) grated Parmesan cheese, Parmigiano-Reggiano recommended

Instructions
------------

Cook orzo.

Heat oil in a large pot. Add zucchini, carrots and onion; sauté over high heat
until onion is transparent, about 7 minutes. Add kale; sauté until wilted,
about 3 to 5 minutes.

Add diced tomatoes, broth and beans. Simmer until carrots are tender, about 20
minutes. Stir in cooked orzo, salt and pepper.

To serve, pour into bowls and sprinkle with cheese. Yields about 1 cup of soup
and 1 1/2 tablespoons of cheese per serving.

Flavor Booster: Stir 1/4 cup of coarsely chopped fresh basil and the grated
zest of 1 lemon into the soup; simmer for 5 minutes before serving.
