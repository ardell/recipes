Ingredients
-----------
- 2 cups basmati rice (500 ml) 
- 3 cups boiling water (750 ml) 
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

Instructions
------------

Rinse the rice: Using a strainer, rinse the rice under cold, running water.

Soak the rice (optional): Place the rice in a large bowlful of cold water, and
let it soak for 30 minutes to an hour. You can skip this step, but it helps
make softer rice.

Transfer rice to a heavy based sauce pot with lid: If you've been soaking the
rice, drain it well. Transfer it to the sauce pot with a pinch of salt.

Pour boiling water over the rice: Boil water in a kettle or pot, measure out 3
cups of boiling water and pour over the rice.

Bring to a simmer, then cover with foil and the lid: Set the pot over
medium-high heat. When the water starts boiling and steaming again, cover the
pot tightly with aluminum foil, crimping the edges around the rim of the pot
(so that no steam escapes), and then place the lid on top.

Reduce heat and cook the rice: Turn down the heat to just above it's lowest
setting and let the rice cook for 15 minutes undisturbed.

Remove from heat and steam for 5 minutes: After 15 minutes, remove the pot from
heat. With the lid still on (no peeking!), let the rice steam another 5
minutes.

Fluff the rice and serve: Uncover the rice, fluff it up with a fork and serve.
