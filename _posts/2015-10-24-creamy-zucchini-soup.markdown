Ingredients
-----------
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, chopped
- 2 pounds zucchini (about 5 medium), chopped
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- 4 cups low or no-sodium vegetable broth
- 1/4 cup raw cashews or 1/8 cup raw cashew butter
- 4 cups baby spinach
- 2 cups corn kernels *
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper or to taste

Instructions
------------

Add onion, garlic, zucchini, basil, thyme, oregano and vegetable broth to a
large soup pot. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 25 minutes or until
zucchini is tender.

Pour into a food processor or high powered blender (in batches, if necessary),
add the cashews and blend until smooth and creamy.

Return soup to the pot, add corn and baby spinach, bring to a simmer and cook
until spinach is wilted. Add water if needed to adjust consistency. Season with
black pepper.

**Note:** Use fresh or defrosted frozen corn kernels. If using fresh corn, boil 2 ears
of corn until tender, about 4 minutes. Cut kernels from cobs with a sharp
knife.
